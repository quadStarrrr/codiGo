# codiGo

codiGo is a convenient workspace where users can collaborate to solve problems and
make connections. 

Have a tough coding problem? Register a new account or login and ask for 
help from our large, compassionate community of users. Feeling helpful? Come solve some
challenges and make someone's day. 

If you post a question that receives an acceptable answer, don't forget to mark that 
question as solved (also, don't forget to implement the functionality that allows you
to do that.)

Use our collaboration pages to post your code or see other codiGos. With codiGo, it's 
easy for users to get the help they need. Just don't forget, the number one rule is to have fun!
